		<h2>DYBA</h2>
		<p>D'Evelyn Youth Basketball Association is a club that provides an opportunity for Dennison and Dâ€™Evelyn girls and boys to play league basketball. We have teams from 2nd through 8th grade. Our 2nd through 8th grade teams play in the Jeffco Basketball Conference. Some of our 4th through 8th grade teams will also play in the Gold Crown league. </p>
		<p>Our team placement fee is $15 and our annual membership dues are $50. These funds are used to cover the costs of running the club. You must be a member of the club to play on our teams.</p>
		<p>2018 Team Placement is on Sunday, September 23rd. Click on the Registration button to get started. Click on the Team Placement button for this year's schedule.</p>
		<p>* We encourage kindergartners and 1st graders to attend the annual team placement to have some fun, get a t-shirt and get some experience with the process. Most of these kids will not be placed on a DYBA team. Depending on size and skill level, 1st graders may be invited to play on a 2nd grade team. For the rest, the YMCA league is a good option.</p>
